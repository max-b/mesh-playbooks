`debops.etc_services` role can be used to "reserve" or "register"
a service port in `/etc/services` file. Service ports configured this way
can appear as named entries in many command outputs, such as
`iptables -L` or `netstat -lp`.  You can also have convenient database
of reserved and free ports on a particular host, and reference ports by
their names in firewall configuration files.

### Installation

This role requires at least Ansible `v1.7.0`. To install it, run:

    ansible-galaxy install debops.etc_services
