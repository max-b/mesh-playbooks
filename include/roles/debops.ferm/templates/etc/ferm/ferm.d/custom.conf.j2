{#
#    ==== Custom ip(6)tables rules for debops.ferm role ====
#
# Rules created by this template should be defined in ferm configuration
# format, in 'item.rules' variable as YAML text block. See ferm(1) manual for
# information abut ferm syntax.
#
# Remember that ferm by default configures both iptables and ip6tables at the
# same time and write your rules accordingly. For example, put them in:
#
#   domain (ip ip6) table filter chain OUTPUT { }
#
# You can also use @if ferm function to specify only a particular domain:
#
#   @if @eq($DOMAIN, ip) { }
#
# To filter the list of IP addresses for a particular domain, you can use
# the ipfilter() ferm function. See examples of dport_* rules for usage patterns.
